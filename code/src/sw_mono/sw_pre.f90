!  This file is part of the DassFlow software (Data Assimilation for Free Surface Flows).
!  DassFlow is a computational software whose purpose is to simulate geophysical free surface flows,
!  designed for variational sensitivities and data assimilation (4D-var). Inverse capabilities are
!  based on the adjoint code generation by a source-to-source algorithmic differentiation (Tapenade software used).
!
!  DassFlow software includes few mostly independent "modules" with common architectures and structures.
!  Please consult the DassFlow webpage for more details: http://www-gmm.insa-toulouse.fr/~monnier/DassFlow/.
!
!  Many people have contributed to the DassFlow development from the initial version to the latest ones.
!  Current contributions:
!               L. Pujol (PhD Unistra)
!               L. Villenave (PhD student)
!               P.-A. Garambois (INRAE Aix-en-Provence)
