A file named 'restart.bin' is written in addition to the model output result files.
In particular, it can be used to perform a long simulation in several times setting the variable <max_nt_for_direct>
to a maximum number of iterations to perform for each part of the long simulation.

This 'restart.bin' file can be renamed in 'ic.bin' file and used as an initial condition.
